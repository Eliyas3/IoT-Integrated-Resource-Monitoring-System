 IoT-Integrated Resource Monitoring System

üîπ Overview
An Operating System-based IoT project designed for real-time monitoring, analysis, and control of system resources like CPU temperature, RAM usage, and current flow. This advanced system uses ESP32/ESP8266, various sensors, MQTT, and cloud integration to ensure efficient and smart resource management. It is highly scalable, secure, and expandable with AI/ML, mobile, and voice control integrations.


üîπ Features

‚úÖ Real-time Monitoring ‚Äì Tracks system temperature, power usage, CPU, and memory.

‚úÖ Fault Detection & Alerts ‚Äì Sends notifications on abnormal resource usage.

‚úÖ Cloud Data Storage ‚Äì Stores system data on Firebase for remote access.

‚úÖ Web-Based Dashboard ‚Äì Visualizes live system metrics interactively.

‚úÖ Multi-device Support ‚Äì Monitors multiple IoT devices simultaneously.

‚úÖ Energy Optimization ‚Äì Uses AI-based analysis to improve efficiency.

üîπ System Architecture

1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Components

ESP32 / NodeMCU / Raspberry Pi (for data collection)
DHT11 Sensor (measures system/environment temperature)
ACS712 Current Sensor (monitors power consumption)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Software Components

Operating System: FreeRTOS / Linux / Zephyr RTOS
Communication Protocols: MQTT / HTTP API
Cloud Storage: Firebase / AWS IoT / ThingsBoard
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dashboard)
Backend: Python (Flask/Django) / Node.js

üîπ How It Works

1. Sensors collect system resource data (temperature, memory, current).
2. Data is sent via MQTT/HTTP to cloud and dashboards.
3. AI/ML models analyze data for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.
4. Mobile and Web dashboards display real-time graphs and alerts.
5. Voice Assistants (Alexa/Google) can query system status.
6. Actuators/Relays trigger actions like cooling or reboot in case of anomalies.

üíª Software & Tools

1. Arduino IDE / PlatformIO for ESP firmware.
2. Firebase/Thingspeak/MQTT Broker (Mosquitto/CloudMQTT) for data storage and communication.
3. TensorFlow Lite / TinyML for AI-based predictive maintenance.
4. IFTTT / Alexa / Google Assistant for voice integration.
5. Mobile App (Blynk, IoT MQTT Panel) for remote monitoring and control.
