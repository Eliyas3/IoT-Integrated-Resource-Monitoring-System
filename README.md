📌 IoT-Integrated Resource Monitoring System

🔹 Overview
The IoT-Integrated Resource Monitoring System is designed to monitor and optimize resource usage (CPU, memory, temperature, power, and network bandwidth) in real-time using IoT technology and operating system principles. It enables remote monitoring, fault detection, and predictive maintenance in smart systems.

🔹 Features
✅ Real-time Monitoring – Tracks system temperature, power usage, CPU, and memory.
✅ Fault Detection & Alerts – Sends notifications on abnormal resource usage.
✅ Cloud Data Storage – Stores system data on Firebase for remote access.
✅ Web-Based Dashboard – Visualizes live system metrics interactively.
✅ Multi-device Support – Monitors multiple IoT devices simultaneously.
✅ Energy Optimization – Uses AI-based analysis to improve efficiency.
